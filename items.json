Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Serge Azria, a visionary and well known name in the industry has re-launched the illustrious brand 'Equipment' which in the 1970's under Christian Restoin revolutionised fashion by introducing men's shirts into women's wardrobes - transforming a men's classic into an item of women's clothing with glam appeal. The new collection recalls the classic, minimalistic undertones of the Equipment brand, fusing unparalleled French sophistication with an air of effortlessly chic, laid-back, California style. Timeless and innovative, the collection features modern, androgynous silhouettes, discreet sexiness, luxe fabrics, unexpected details and feminine riffs on men's shirting. The range of prints, fabrics and silhouette styles negotiate the many facets of the Equipment woman: she is strong, chic, elegant, adventurous, sexy and is above all, classic."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Serge Azria, a visionary and well known name in the industry has re-launched the illustrious brand 'Equipment' which in the 1970's under Christian Restoin revolutionised fashion by introducing men's shirts into women's wardrobes - transforming a men's classic into an item of women's clothing with glam appeal. The new collection recalls the classic, minimalistic undertones of the Equipment brand, fusing unparalleled French sophistication with an air of effortlessly chic, laid-back, California style. Timeless and innovative, the collection features modern, androgynous silhouettes, discreet sexiness, luxe fabrics, unexpected details and feminine riffs on men's shirting. The range of prints, fabrics and silhouette styles negotiate the many facets of the Equipment woman: she is strong, chic, elegant, adventurous, sexy and is above all, classic."},

Gryphon's designer, Aimee Cho, is a former Fashion Writer for Vogue Magazine, where she worked for 6 years. While Cho was still at Vogue, a brainstorming meeting about the essential building blocks of a modern wardrobe prompted an idea for a business. She realized that of the foundation pieces discussed - a tee-shirt, a cashmere knit, a tailored pantsuit, great fitting jeans, a city tote and a chic trench coat \u2013 numerous resources exist for all categories at a wide range of price-points except for the trench. The romantic yet strong image of the origins of the trench coat \u2013 the brave soldier protected from the elements \u2013 appealed to Cho. A vision for a brand began to emerge and Gryphon New York was born."},

In June 2011, Derek Lam presented his first ever diffusion line\"10 Crosby Derek Lam\u201d named after the address of the Derek Lam International, LLC headquarters in downtown Manhattan. \"My idea for this collection is to reach a woman who wants urban clothing that will carry her through every aspect of her life, from the more formal, go to work occasions and also for the more informal aspects of her life. It really is the look which I see all around me, whether it be right out my window, on Crosby street, to Los Angeles or Dallas.\u201d He also added, \"this new line has a more accessible approach while maintaining my core principles: Clothing of value and integrity of design.\u201d What is unique to \"10 Crosby Derek Lam\u201d is its intelligent sense of style combined with surprising twists that will make the collection look and feel special."},

Gryphon's designer, Aimee Cho, is a former Fashion Writer for Vogue Magazine, where she worked for 6 years. While Cho was still at Vogue, a brainstorming meeting about the essential building blocks of a modern wardrobe prompted an idea for a business. She realized that of the foundation pieces discussed - a tee-shirt, a cashmere knit, a tailored pantsuit, great fitting jeans, a city tote and a chic trench coat \u2013 numerous resources exist for all categories at a wide range of price-points except for the trench. The romantic yet strong image of the origins of the trench coat \u2013 the brave soldier protected from the elements \u2013 appealed to Cho. A vision for a brand began to emerge and Gryphon New York was born."},

Gryphon's designer, Aimee Cho, is a former Fashion Writer for Vogue Magazine, where she worked for 6 years. While Cho was still at Vogue, a brainstorming meeting about the essential building blocks of a modern wardrobe prompted an idea for a business. She realized that of the foundation pieces discussed - a tee-shirt, a cashmere knit, a tailored pantsuit, great fitting jeans, a city tote and a chic trench coat \u2013 numerous resources exist for all categories at a wide range of price-points except for the trench. The romantic yet strong image of the origins of the trench coat \u2013 the brave soldier protected from the elements \u2013 appealed to Cho. A vision for a brand began to emerge and Gryphon New York was born."},

The SIMONE girl is many girls, but it all began with the original SIMONE girl: Katie Simone Nehra, the designer behind the collection. Katie is an artist, and has been acting for years. In 2006 Katie decided to marry her love of fashion and her creativity and began the SIMONE collection. Like any girl, she dreamed of pieces that she could not find in the market, and decided to follow her instincts and create something different. What started out as a small collection of all dresses, named after her fashionable friends, has now grown into a full collection of tops, jackets, dresses, blouses and leather pieces. The collection is equal parts girly and rock and roll, and really depends on the wearer itself, which is exactly how Katie wanted it to be."},

The SIMONE girl is many girls, but it all began with the original SIMONE girl: Katie Simone Nehra, the designer behind the collection. Katie is an artist, and has been acting for years. In 2006 Katie decided to marry her love of fashion and her creativity and began the SIMONE collection. Like any girl, she dreamed of pieces that she could not find in the market, and decided to follow her instincts and create something different. What started out as a small collection of all dresses, named after her fashionable friends, has now grown into a full collection of tops, jackets, dresses, blouses and leather pieces. The collection is equal parts girly and rock and roll, and really depends on the wearer itself, which is exactly how Katie wanted it to be."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition.

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes.

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes.

Serge Azria, a visionary and well known name in the industry has re-launched the illustrious brand 'Equipment' which in the 1970's under Christian Restoin revolutionised fashion by introducing men's shirts into women's wardrobes - transforming a men's classic into an item of women's clothing with glam appeal. The new collection recalls the classic, minimalistic undertones of the Equipment brand, fusing unparalleled French sophistication with an air of effortlessly chic, laid-back, California style. Timeless and innovative, the collection features modern, androgynous silhouettes, discreet sexiness, luxe fabrics, unexpected details and feminine riffs on men's shirting. The range of prints, fabrics and silhouette styles negotiate the many facets of the Equipment woman: she is strong, chic, elegant, adventurous, sexy and is above all, classic."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition.

In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Serge Azria, a visionary and well known name in the industry has re-launched the illustrious brand 'Equipment' which in the 1970's under Christian Restoin revolutionised fashion by introducing men's shirts into women's wardrobes - transforming a men's classic into an item of women's clothing with glam appeal. The new collection recalls the classic, minimalistic undertones of the Equipment brand, fusing unparalleled French sophistication with an air of effortlessly chic, laid-back, California style. Timeless and innovative, the collection features modern, androgynous silhouettes, discreet sexiness, luxe fabrics, unexpected details and feminine riffs on men's shirting. The range of prints, fabrics and silhouette styles negotiate the many facets of the Equipment woman: she is strong, chic, elegant, adventurous, sexy and is above all, classic."},

Gryphon's designer, Aimee Cho, is a former Fashion Writer for Vogue Magazine, where she worked for 6 years. While Cho was still at Vogue, a brainstorming meeting about the essential building blocks of a modern wardrobe prompted an idea for a business. She realized that of the foundation pieces discussed - a tee-shirt, a cashmere knit, a tailored pantsuit, great fitting jeans, a city tote and a chic trench coat \u2013 numerous resources exist for all categories at a wide range of price-points except for the trench. The romantic yet strong image of the origins of the trench coat \u2013 the brave soldier protected from the elements \u2013 appealed to Cho. A vision for a brand began to emerge and Gryphon New York was born."},

Gryphon's designer, Aimee Cho, is a former Fashion Writer for Vogue Magazine, where she worked for 6 years. While Cho was still at Vogue, a brainstorming meeting about the essential building blocks of a modern wardrobe prompted an idea for a business. She realized that of the foundation pieces discussed - a tee-shirt, a cashmere knit, a tailored pantsuit, great fitting jeans, a city tote and a chic trench coat \u2013 numerous resources exist for all categories at a wide range of price-points except for the trench. The romantic yet strong image of the origins of the trench coat \u2013 the brave soldier protected from the elements \u2013 appealed to Cho. A vision for a brand began to emerge and Gryphon New York was born."},

Gryphon's designer, Aimee Cho, is a former Fashion Writer for Vogue Magazine, where she worked for 6 years. While Cho was still at Vogue, a brainstorming meeting about the essential building blocks of a modern wardrobe prompted an idea for a business. She realized that of the foundation pieces discussed - a tee-shirt, a cashmere knit, a tailored pantsuit, great fitting jeans, a city tote and a chic trench coat \u2013 numerous resources exist for all categories at a wide range of price-points except for the trench. The romantic yet strong image of the origins of the trench coat \u2013 the brave soldier protected from the elements \u2013 appealed to Cho. A vision for a brand began to emerge and Gryphon New York was born."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Serge Azria, a visionary and well known name in the industry has re-launched the illustrious brand 'Equipment' which in the 1970's under Christian Restoin revolutionised fashion by introducing men's shirts into women's wardrobes - transforming a men's classic into an item of women's clothing with glam appeal. The new collection recalls the classic, minimalistic undertones of the Equipment brand, fusing unparalleled French sophistication with an air of effortlessly chic, laid-back, California style. Timeless and innovative, the collection features modern, androgynous silhouettes, discreet sexiness, luxe fabrics, unexpected details and feminine riffs on men's shirting. The range of prints, fabrics and silhouette styles negotiate the many facets of the Equipment woman: she is strong, chic, elegant, adventurous, sexy and is above all, classic."},
