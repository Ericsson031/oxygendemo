Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

Giuseppe Zanotti comes from a small town a few miles from Fellini\u2019s Rimini, famous for its great shoe manufacturing tradition. In the early 90\u2019s he felt the need to create models and styles without any bounds, and that is when he bought the Vicini shoe factory. \u00a0He focused everything on a formula of creativity and craftsmanship of the highest level. Giuseppe saw the shoe factory as something more akin to a fashion house set up to meet the needs of every woman\u2019s foot, and not as an industrial concern that mass produces tedious shoes. Over the years his spirit has remained the same - na\u00eff and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 while keeping one eye on the past and on the manufacturing tradition and the other on the future and on research."},

As the Sydney Morning Herald so nicely puts it, \"If Sydney was personified, she'd be bronzed, brazen and\u2026wearing a Zimmermann bikini, so synonymous has the sunny label become with Australian style."},
